# Firebot

Firebot is a bot designed for the game Firestone Idle RPG. This bot aims to enhance the gaming experience by automating various tasks and providing useful features for players.

## About
This project is a mod for the game Firestone Idle RPG, using [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) **Nightly V0.7.2+**.

> **Note:** Firebot is currently supported only on **Windows**. The mod works with Firestone Idle RPG in **any game language**, at **any resolution**, and can run in the **background**.

## Features
- **Offline Progress**: Automatically claims offline progress rewards
- **Tools Production** (Engineer): Automatically collects produced tools from the Engineer
- **Warfront Campaign**: Automatically collects Warfront campaign scrolls
- **Missions**: Manages missions automatically - claims completed mission rewards and starts new missions with available squads
- **Expeditions**: Manages expeditions - claims completed expedition rewards and starts new expeditions when available
- **Firestone Research** (Library): Automatically starts research and claims completed research
- **Oracle Rituals**: Claims completed rituals and starts new rituals when available
- **Guardian Training** (Magic Quarters): Automatically initiates guardian training


## How to Use (Pre-built Release)

If you want to use the pre-built mod, follow these steps:

1. **Download** the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/firebot/releases) page (e.g., `firebot-v0.1.0-alpha.zip`).

2. **Extract** the contents of the zip file into the root folder of Firestone Idle RPG (where the game executable is located).
   - The zip file already contains the `Mods`, `UserData`, and `UserLibs` folders with all necessary files.
   - If prompted, allow overwriting existing files.
3. Make sure [MelonLoader Nightly V0.7.2+](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) is installed in your game.
4. Start the game normally. Firebot will be loaded automatically by MelonLoader.

By default, press **F7** to start or stop the bot during gameplay.

## Installation (From Source)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/firebot.git](https://github.com/yourusername/firebot.git)
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd firebot
   ```

3. Configure the path to your Firestone Idle RPG game directory by editing the `src/Directory.Build.props` file if needed:
    - By default, the path is set to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Firestone` (Windows). If your game is installed elsewhere, change the `<GameRoot>` property in this file to the correct path.
    - You can also set the environment variable `COMMON_DIR` to override the base directory. In this case, the game path will be `$(COMMON_DIR)\Firestone`.
      - Example:
          ```xml
          <GameRoot>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Firestone</GameRoot>
          ```

4. Build the project using your preferred method (e.g., Visual Studio, command line).


## CONFIG:

The bot configuration file can be found at `Firestone/UserData/FirebotPreferences.cfg`.

Default toggle key: **F7** (changeable via `shortcut_key`).

For now, all configuration must be done directly in this file. A graphical configuration interface will be implemented in the future.

Here is a list of the current config options (and their default values):

```toml
[firebot_settings]
# Determines if the bot logic should be initialized and started automatically upon game launch.
auto_start = false
# The initial cooldown (in seconds) before the bot begins execution.
# Useful for preventing conflicts while Unity is still loading the initial scene.
# Clamped between 10.0 and 120.0 seconds.
start_bot_delay = 10.0
# The interval (in seconds) between each BotManager verification cycle.
# Lower values make the bot more responsive but may impact FPS performance.
# Clamped between 1.0 and 3600.0 seconds.
scan_interval = 2.0
# The delay (in seconds) between individual UI interactions (clicks, transitions).
# Ensures the game processes the command before the next action is taken. 
# Clamped between 0.5 and 5.0 seconds.
interaction_delay = 1.0
# Enables verbose logging and StackTrace display in the console for easier bug identification.
debug_mode = false
# The physical key used to manually toggle the bot's execution state during gameplay.
# Default: "F7"
shortcut_key = "F7"

## Disclaimer: Not a Cheat

Firebot **is not a cheat**. It does not modify game resources, grant unfair advantages, interfere with server logic, or alter game files. The bot only automates actions that a player could perform manually, without bypassing any security or protection mechanisms of the game.

## Technical Details

- Firebot is implemented as a mod using MelonLoader, enabling automation of repetitive tasks within the game client itself.
- All actions performed by the bot simulate clicks and commands that a user would normally do, without modifying server data or circumventing security systems.
- The code is open source and auditable, ensuring transparency about its operation.
